# What is Fungible Asset (FA)

Hey there! Let's chat about tokens in blockchain. Think of them as digital goodies that represent stuff on a blockchain platform. They're like the building blocks for all sorts of cool decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts. Here's a fun breakdown:

| Token Standards | Like ERC-20 (Ethereum) or BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain). These are the rules of the game, making sure tokens play nice with wallets and exchanges. |
| --- | --- |
| Smart Contracts | The brains behind tokens. They set the rules for creating, moving, and owning tokens. Developers can get creative with these! |
| Decentralization | Tokens live on a blockchain network. It's like a big, shared notebook that lots of computers keep an eye on. Super transparent and secure! |
| Use Cases | Tokens can be all sorts of things: cryptocurrencies (hello, Bitcoin!), utility tokens (like a VIP pass to a service), or even represent ownership in something valuable. |
| Transfers | You can send tokens to other addresses on the blockchain. It's all recorded and double-checked with fancy math signatures. No takebacks! |
| Ownership | Your tokens are yours thanks to private keys. These are like super-secret passwords. Keep 'em safe! |
| Interoperability | Tokens can chat with other tokens and dApps on the same blockchain. It's like a big digital playground! |
| Scalability | Sometimes, blockchains get a bit crowded with too many token transactions. This can lead to traffic jams and pricier fees. Something to keep in mind when building! |

Now, let's talk about Movement. They've got two ways to create and manage tokens: Coin and Fungible Asset. Coin's the OG, launched with Movement mainnet (we'll chat about that another topic). For now, let's dive into the cool new kid on the block - the Fungible Asset standard!

With Fungible Asset, you can:

- Create and manage your very own fungible asset (fancy!)
- Play around with a user's fungible store (like a digital wallet) for a specific fungible asset
- Set a max supply limit - no unlimited minting here! (Something Coin can't do)
- Get super detailed with permissions for minting, burning, freezing, force transferring, and more
- Use a freezing feature that actually works! (Unlike Coin's FreezeCapability, which is a bit limited)

Pretty cool, right? Fungible Asset gives you way more control and flexibility compared to the older Coin standard. It's like upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone!
